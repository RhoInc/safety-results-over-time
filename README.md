# Saftey Results Over Time
![Example](https://github.com/RhoInc/safety-results-over-time/wiki/img/default.PNG)

## Overview
Safety Results Over Time is a JavaScript library built using Webcharts ([1](https://github.com/RhoInc/Webcharts), [2](https://github.com/RhoInc/webcharts-wrapper-boilerplate)) that allows users to view summaries of clinical outcomes such as lab results and vital signs over time. A typical chart created with safety results over time looks like the chart pictured above. 
Users can specify grouping variables and overlay violin plots:

Users can view any outcome in the data and stratify that outcome by sex or treatment, for example; the full functionality is described [here](https://github.com/RhoInc/safety-results-over-time/wiki/Technical-Documentation).
The library expects an [ADaM-esque data structure](https://www.cdisc.org/system/files/members/standard/foundational/adam/analysis_data_model_v2.1.pdf) by default but can be customized to use any dataset that is one row per participant per timepoint per measure.
Full details about chart configuration are [here](https://github.com/RhoInc/safety-results-over-time/wiki/Configuration).

Users can interact with the display in real time to:
* See the chart compare lab and vital sign values at different time points
* See the number and percentage of participants displayed in the current view (updates with each user interaction)
* Change the measure of interest, and see an updated chart
* Hide visits that do not include data
* View box plots within the chart
* Remove box plots from the chart
* View violin plots in the chart
* Remove violin plots in the chart
* Filter the shift plot for selected criteria, and see an updated chart (optional)


## Typical Usage
The code to initialize the chart looks like this: 

```javascript

    d3.csv(
        'https://rawgit.com/RhoInc/viz-library/master/data/safetyData/ADBDS.csv',
        function(data) {
            safetyResultsOverTime('body', {}).init(data);
        }
    );

```

The chart can be configured to facilitate non-standard data formats and to alter the chart itself. Overwrite the defaults with a custom settings object like so:

```javascript
    const settings = {
        time_settings: {
            value_col: 'AVISIT',
            type: 'ordinal',
            label: 'Visit',
            rotate_tick_labels: true,
            vertical_space: 100
        },
        measure_col: 'PARAM',
        value_col: 'AVAL',
        normal_col_low: 'ANRLO',
        normal_col_high: 'ANRHI',
        groups: [
            {value_col: 'TRT01P', label: 'Treatment Group'},
            {value_col: 'SEX', label: 'Sex'},
            {value_col: 'RACE', label: 'Race'}],
        ],
        filters: [
            {value_col: 'TRT01P', label: 'Treatment Group'},
            {value_col: 'SEX', label: 'Sex'},
            {value_col: 'RACE', label: 'Race'}
        ],
        violins: true
    };

    d3.csv(
        'ADBDS.csv',
        function(data) {
            safetyResultsOverTime('body', settings).init(data);
        }
    );
```
